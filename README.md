This project concerns predicting customer churn for a concept music streaming service named as **Sparkify**. 

The project involves:
 - Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB) 
 - Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
 - Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
 - Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes

## Required Python Libraries
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - PySpark SQL
 - PySpark ML 
 
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.
